# Build the Docker image using the Dockerfile
build:
# This command runs `docker-compose build`, which creates the Docker image
# by using the Dockerfile in the current directory. If the image is already built,
# it will only rebuild if there are changes to the Dockerfile or build context.
	docker-compose build

build_and_up:

	docker-compose up -d --build

# Start the services in the background
up:
# This command runs `docker-compose up -d`, which starts the container(s) defined
# in the docker-compose.yml file in detached mode (background). The ports will be exposed,
# and the container will run as defined.
	docker-compose up -d

# Stop and remove the services
down:
# This stops and removes all running containers and associated resources
# like networks created by `docker-compose up`.
	docker-compose down

# Restart the services
restart:
# This command restarts the containers. It can be useful for refreshing
# services without stopping and removing them completely.
	docker-compose restart

# View real-time logs of the running containers
logs:
# This command follows (`-f`) the logs of all services, allowing you to monitor
# output in real time.
# docker-compose log -f <CONTAINER ID>  	
	docker-compose logs -f
